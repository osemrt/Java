• This example is a demonstration of how to:
&nbsp; &nbsp; • define an inner class
&nbsp; &nbsp; • access the outer object from the inner object
• The inner class in the previous example is private.
&nbsp; &nbsp; • Therefore, it is hidden from all classes, including the ones within the same package.
&nbsp; &nbsp; • Which means, the Person.main method cannot be moved to any other class.
